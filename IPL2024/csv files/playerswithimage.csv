In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn.

Ajinkya Rahane,Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"Ajinkya Rahane is a top-order Mumbai batsman who, with 1089 runs in his second Ranji season, was a crucial factor in Mumbai's 38th title win. Only 11 players have scored 1000 runs in a single Ranji season, and that puts his effort in perspective. Rahane's progression to the Mumbai Ranji team was a natural one - he had represented them at all age levels, and was always seen as a prospective Mumbai player if not more. His bumper Ranji season followed an impressive showing in the 2007-08 Duleep Trophy, where he scored 172 against an England Lions attack that comprised Graham Onions, Monty Panesar, Steve Kirby and Liam Plunkett. That innings came after followers of Mumbai cricket had started to write him off as a a fine talent but fit only to make a swift 50.

He came into his own in the same event two years later, in Australia, where he took four wickets in the final, against the hosts, and finished as the joint-highest wicket-taker for India (12). As a result, Sandeep was signed by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2013 season. In three seasons for his franchise, Sandeep not only took 39 wickets, but was regularly employed by his captain George Bailey to bowl the death overs. Sandeep was soon drafted into India's T20 side for the two-match series against Zimbabwe in 2015, where he failed to deliver. In 2014, however, Sandeep suffered a stress fracture of the back that kept him out of competitive cricket for five months.
